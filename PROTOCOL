Protocol for communications between subscribers and server.

    Communications are expected in json.
    Communications may contain more than one option.



FROM SERVER TO SUBSCRIBER :

Three requests are currently supported or under development:
    ping -- client should send a ping to the broker.
    die -- client process should end.
    randomize -- client should randomize the offset of its ping interval.
{
    "request":"ping",
    "request":"die",
    "request":"randomize"
}

FROM SUBSCRIBER TO SERVER :

One message is supported, which simply tells the server that it is still alive:
    GUID -- the subscriber's GUID
{
    "GUID":"[GUID]"
}
